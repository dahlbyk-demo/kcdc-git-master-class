# Git `master` Class

"It's just version control." Or is it? When I started using `git-svn` more than
five years ago, I never imagined how fundamentally Git would change the way I
develop software. This session will cast new light on the basic Git commands
you already know as a first step into a hands-on exploration of the more
advanced tools at our disposal to develop software on our terms. Topics covered
will include local and distributed workflows, history inspection and
manipulation, and a glimpse into the power available through tools like
filter-branch`.
